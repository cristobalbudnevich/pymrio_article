  title =         {Consumption-Based Accounting of {{CO2}} Emissions},
  abstract =      {CO2 emissions from the burning of fossil fuels are
                   the primary cause of global warming. Much attention
                   has been focused on the CO2 directly emitted by each
                   country, but relatively little attention has been
                   paid to the amount of emissions associated with the
                   consumption of goods and services in each country.
                   Consumption-based accounting of CO2 emissions differs
                   from traditional, production-based inventories
                   because of imports and exports of goods and services
                   that, either directly or indirectly, involve CO2
                   emissions. Here, using the latest available data, we
                   present a global consumption-based CO2 emissions
                   inventory and calculations of associated
                   consumption-based energy and carbon intensities. We
                   find that, in 2004, 23\% of global CO2 emissions, or
                   6.2 gigatonnes CO2, were traded internationally,
                   primarily as exports from China and other emerging
                   markets to consumers in developed countries. In some
                   wealthy countries, including Switzerland, Sweden,
                   Austria, the United Kingdom, and France, $>$30\% of
                   consumption-based emissions were imported, with net
                   imports to many Europeans of $>$4 tons CO2 per person
                   in 2004. Net import of emissions to the United States
                   in the same year was somewhat less: 10.8\% of total
                   consumption-based emissions and 2.4 tons CO2 per
                   person. In contrast, 22.5\% of the emissions produced
                   in China in 2004 were exported, on net, to consumers
                   elsewhere. Consumption-based accounting of CO2
                   emissions demonstrates the potential for
                   international carbon leakage. Sharing responsibility
                   for emissions among producers and consumers could
                   facilitate international agreement on global climate
                   policy that is now hindered by concerns over the
                   regional and historical inequity of emissions.},

  volume =        {12},
  abstract =      {While the EU Commission has encouraged Member States
                   to combine national and international climate change
                   mitigation measures with subnational environmental
                   policies, there has been little harmonized effort
                   towards the quantification of embodied greenhouse gas
                   (GHG) emissions from household consumption across
                   European regions. This study develops an inventory of
                   carbon footprints associated with household
                   consumption for 177 regions in 27 EU countries, thus,
                   making a key contribution for the incorporation of
                   consumption-based accounting into local
                   decision-making. Footprint calculations are based on
                   consumer expenditure surveys and environmental and
                   trade detail from the EXIOBASE 2.3 multiregional
                   input-output database describing the world economy in
                   2007 at the detail of 43 countries, 5
                   rest-of-the-world regions and 200 product sectors.
                   Our analysis highlights the spatial heterogeneity of
                   embodied GHG emissions within multiregional countries
                   with subnational ranges varying widely between 0.6
                   and 6.5 tCO 2 e/cap. The significant differences in
                   regional contribution in terms of total and per
                   capita emissions suggest notable differences with
                   regards to climate change responsibility. The study
                   further provides a breakdown of regional emissions by
                   consumption categories (e.g. housing, mobility,
                   food). In addition, our region-level study evaluates
                   driving forces of carbon footprints through a set of
                   socio-economic, geographic and technical factors.
                   Income is singled out as the most important driver
                   for a region's carbon footprint, although its
                   explanatory power varies significantly across
                   consumption domains. Additional factors that stand
                   out as important on the regional level include
                   household size, urban-rural typology, level of
                   education, expenditure patterns, temperature,
                   resource availability and carbon intensity of the
                   electricity mix. The lack of cross-national
                   region-level studies has so far prevented analysts
                   from drawing broader policy conclusions that hold
                   beyond national and regional borders.},

                   Endowments},
  volume =        {40},
  abstract =      {The European Union (EU) has proposed in its
                   Resource-efficiency roadmap a `dashboard of
                   indicators' consisting of four headline indicators
                   for carbon, water, land and materials. The EU
                   recognizes the need to use a consumption-based (or
                   `footprint') perspective to capture the global
                   dimension of resources and their impacts. In this
                   paper, we analyse how the EU's footprints compare to
                   those of other nations, to what extent the EU and
                   other major economies of the world rely on embodied
                   resource imports, and what the implications are for
                   policy making based on this comparison. This study is
                   the first comprehensive multi-indicator comparison of
                   all four policy relevant indicators, and uses a
                   single consistent global Multi-Regional Input Output
                   (MRIO) database with a unique and high level of
                   product detail across countries. We find that Europe
                   is the only region in the world that relies on net
                   embodied imports for all indicators considered. We
                   further find that the powerful economies of China and
                   others in the Asia-Pacific already dominate global
                   resource consumption from a footprint perspective,
                   while they still haven't reached the prosperity of
                   developed countries. Competition for resources is
                   hence likely to increase, making Europe even more
                   vulnerable. A hot spot analysis suggests that final
                   consumption of food, transport and housing are
                   priorities for reduction efforts along the life
                   cycle. Further, countries with a similar Human
                   Development Index can have very different footprints,
                   pointing at societal organisation at macro-level as
                   option for improvement. This points at options for
                   countries for lowering their footprint, becoming less
                   dependent on embodied imports, while maintaining a
                   high quality of life.},

                   assessment (LCA) has recently been significantly
                   improved. Advances include the consideration of
                   several taxa, consideration of vulnerability of
                   species and ecosystems, global coverage and spatial
                   differentiation. To allow a comparison of
                   biodiversity impacts of different stressors (e.g.
                   land and water use), consistent approaches for
                   assessing and aggregating biodiversity impacts across
                   taxa are needed. We propose four different options
                   for aggregating impacts across taxa and stressors:
                   equal weight for species, equal weight for taxa and
                   two options with special consideration of species?
                   vulnerability. We apply the aggregation options to a
                   case study of coffee, tea and sugarcane production in
                   Kenya for the production of 1 kg of crop. The ranking
                   between stressors (land vs. water use) within each
                   crop and also of the overall impact between crops
                   (coffee $>$ sugarcane $>$ tea) remained the same when
                   applying the different aggregation options. Inclusion
                   of the vulnerability of species had significant
                   influence on the magnitude of results, and
                   potentially also on the spatial distribution of
                   impacts, and should be considered.},

                   discipline. The field is becoming more data and
                   computation intensive, which requires IE researchers
                   to develop scientific software to tackle novel
                   research questions. We review the current state of
                   software programming and use in our field and find
                   challenges regarding transparency, reproducibility,
                   reusability, and ease of collaboration. Our response
                   to that problem is fourfold: First, we propose how
                   existing general principles for the development of
                   good scientific software could be implemented in IE
                   and related fields. Second, we argue that
                   collaborating on open source software could make IE
                   research more productive and increase its quality,
                   and we present guidelines for the development and
                   distribution of such software. Third, we call for
                   stricter requirements regarding general access to the
                   source code used to produce research results and
                   scientific claims published in the IE literature.
                   Fourth, we describe a set of open source modules for
                   standard IE modeling tasks that represent our first
                   attempt at turning our recommendations into practice.
                   We introduce a Python toolbox for IE that includes
                   the life cycle assessment (LCA) framework Brightway2,
                   the ecospold2matrix module that parses unallocated
                   data in ecospold format, the pySUT and pymrio modules
                   for building and analyzing multiregion input-output
                   models and supply and use tables, and the
                   dynamic\_stock\_model class for dynamic stock
                   modeling. Widespread use of open access software can,
                   at the same time, increase quality, transparency, and
                   reproducibility of IE research.},

                   is to serve as a feedstock from which researchers can
                   choose any combination of regions and economic
                   sectors to form a model of the economy that is
                   suitable to address their particular research
                   questions. Thus, the Global MRIO Lab concept enables
                   enhanced flexibility in MRIO database construction
                   whilst at the same time saving resources and avoiding
                   duplication, by sharing time- and labour-intensive
                   tasks amongst multiple research teams. We explain the
                   concept, architecture, development and preliminary
                   results of the Global MRIO Lab, and discuss its
                   ability to continuously deliver some of the most
                   prominent world MRIO databases.},

                   multi-region input\textendash{}output (MRIO) database
                   in the Virtual IELab cloud-computing laboratory
                   environment. Whereas EXIOBASE2 is constructed using a
                   multi-process reconciliation procedure, we present an
                   alternative compilation technique that uses
                   EXIOBASE2's pre-processed data and final tables in
                   reconciling the IELab MRIO with conflicting raw data
                   information. This approach skips the labour-intensive
                   step of detailing and harmonising country tables.
                   Adherence metrics reveal the EXIOBASE2-based IELab
                   table to be considerably less balanced than the
                   original but with stronger adherence to other
                   constraints data. However, these metrics are not
                   comparable to the original EXIOBASE2 statistics due
                   to the distinctive implementation of constraint sets
                   in the two platforms. IELab's main value-added is its
                   flexibility in tailoring EXIOBASE2-based MRIOs beyond
                   the original recipe. Finally, IELab's global carbon,
                   water and material footprints are shown to be
                   comparable with previously reported resource
                   footprints. In contrast, deviations in land
                   footprints warrant further investigation.},
