                   these, only geophysical warming commitment has been
                   quantified. We estimated the commitment to future
                   emissions and warming represented by existing carbon
                   dioxide\textendash{}emitting devices. We calculated
                   cumulative future emissions of 496 (282 to 701 in
                   lower- and upper-bounding scenarios) gigatonnes of
                   CO2 from combustion of fossil fuels by existing
                   infrastructure between 2010 and 2060, forcing mean
                   warming of 1.3$^\circ$C (1.1$^\circ$ to 1.4$^\circ$C)
                   above the pre-industrial era and atmospheric
                   concentrations of CO2 less than 430 parts per
                   million. Because these conditions would likely avoid
                   many key impacts of climate change, we conclude that
                   sources of the most threatening emissions have yet to
                   be built. However, CO2-emitting infrastructure will
                   expand unless extraordinary efforts are undertaken to

                   to combine national and international climate change
                   mitigation measures with subnational environmental
                   policies, there has been little harmonized effort
                   towards the quantification of embodied greenhouse gas
                   (GHG) emissions from household consumption across
                   European regions. This study develops an inventory of
                   carbon footprints associated with household
                   consumption for 177 regions in 27 EU countries, thus,
                   making a key contribution for the incorporation of
                   consumption-based accounting into local
                   decision-making. Footprint calculations are based on
                   consumer expenditure surveys and environmental and
                   trade detail from the EXIOBASE 2.3 multiregional
                   input-output database describing the world economy in
                   2007 at the detail of 43 countries, 5
                   rest-of-the-world regions and 200 product sectors.
                   Our analysis highlights the spatial heterogeneity of
                   embodied GHG emissions within multiregional countries
                   with subnational ranges varying widely between 0.6
                   and 6.5 tCO 2 e/cap. The significant differences in
                   regional contribution in terms of total and per
                   capita emissions suggest notable differences with
                   regards to climate change responsibility. The study
                   further provides a breakdown of regional emissions by
                   consumption categories (e.g. housing, mobility,
                   food). In addition, our region-level study evaluates
                   driving forces of carbon footprints through a set of
                   socio-economic, geographic and technical factors.
                   Income is singled out as the most important driver
                   for a region's carbon footprint, although its
                   explanatory power varies significantly across
                   consumption domains. Additional factors that stand
                   out as important on the regional level include
                   household size, urban-rural typology, level of
                   education, expenditure patterns, temperature,
                   resource availability and carbon intensity of the
                   electricity mix. The lack of cross-national
                   region-level studies has so far prevented analysts
                   from drawing broader policy conclusions that hold
                   beyond national and regional borders.},

  abstract =      {The European Union (EU) has proposed in its
                   Resource-efficiency roadmap a `dashboard of
                   indicators' consisting of four headline indicators
                   for carbon, water, land and materials. The EU
                   recognizes the need to use a consumption-based (or
                   `footprint') perspective to capture the global
                   dimension of resources and their impacts. In this
                   paper, we analyse how the EU's footprints compare to
                   those of other nations, to what extent the EU and
                   other major economies of the world rely on embodied
                   resource imports, and what the implications are for
                   policy making based on this comparison. This study is
                   the first comprehensive multi-indicator comparison of
                   all four policy relevant indicators, and uses a
                   single consistent global Multi-Regional Input Output
                   (MRIO) database with a unique and high level of
                   product detail across countries. We find that Europe
                   is the only region in the world that relies on net
                   embodied imports for all indicators considered. We
                   further find that the powerful economies of China and
                   others in the Asia-Pacific already dominate global
                   resource consumption from a footprint perspective,
                   while they still haven't reached the prosperity of
                   developed countries. Competition for resources is
                   hence likely to increase, making Europe even more
                   vulnerable. A hot spot analysis suggests that final
                   consumption of food, transport and housing are
                   priorities for reduction efforts along the life
                   cycle. Further, countries with a similar Human
                   Development Index can have very different footprints,
                   pointing at societal organisation at macro-level as
                   option for improvement. This points at options for
                   countries for lowering their footprint, becoming less
                   dependent on embodied imports, while maintaining a
                   high quality of life.},

                   assessment (LCA) has recently been significantly
                   improved. Advances include the consideration of
                   several taxa, consideration of vulnerability of
                   species and ecosystems, global coverage and spatial
                   differentiation. To allow a comparison of
                   biodiversity impacts of different stressors (e.g.
                   land and water use), consistent approaches for
                   assessing and aggregating biodiversity impacts across
                   taxa are needed. We propose four different options
                   for aggregating impacts across taxa and stressors:
                   equal weight for species, equal weight for taxa and
                   two options with special consideration of species?
                   vulnerability. We apply the aggregation options to a
                   case study of coffee, tea and sugarcane production in
                   Kenya for the production of 1 kg of crop. The ranking
                   between stressors (land vs. water use) within each
                   crop and also of the overall impact between crops
                   (coffee $>$ sugarcane $>$ tea) remained the same when
                   applying the different aggregation options. Inclusion
                   of the vulnerability of species had significant
                   influence on the magnitude of results, and
                   potentially also on the spatial distribution of
                   impacts, and should be considered.},

                   is available to describe socioeconomic metabolism
                   (SEM). Despite the common system of study, a large
                   variety of terms and representations of that system
                   are used by different models. This makes it difficult
                   for practitioners to compare and choose a model or
                   model combination that is fit for purpose. To
                   facilitate model comparison, we analyze the system
                   structure of material flow analysis (MFA); life cycle
                   assessment (LCA); supply and use tables (SUTs);
                   Leontief, Ghosh, and waste input-output analysis;
                   integrated assessment models; and computable general
                   equilibrium models. We show that the typical system
                   structure of MFA and LCA is a directed graph. For the
                   other models and some MFA and LCA studies, the system
                   structure is a bipartite directed graph. We
                   demonstrate that bipartite directed graphs and SUTs
                   are equivalent representations of SEM. We show that
                   the system structures of the models above are special
                   cases of a general system structure, which models SEM
                   as a bipartite graph. The general system structure
                   includes industries, markets, the final use phase,
                   products, waste, production factors, resources, and
                   emissions. From the general system structure, we
                   derive an accounting framework in the form of a
                   generalized SUT. The general system structure
                   facilitates the development of clear and unambiguous
                   terminology across models. It helps to identify rules
                   for the correct accounting of waste flows and stock
                   changes. It facilitates model comparison and can
                   serve as a blueprint for a model-independent database

                   choose any combination of regions and economic
                   sectors to form a model of the economy that is
                   suitable to address their particular research
                   questions. Thus, the Global MRIO Lab concept enables
                   enhanced flexibility in MRIO database construction
                   whilst at the same time saving resources and avoiding
                   duplication, by sharing time- and labour-intensive
                   tasks amongst multiple research teams. We explain the
                   concept, architecture, development and preliminary
                   results of the Global MRIO Lab, and discuss its
                   ability to continuously deliver some of the most
                   prominent world MRIO databases.},

                   multi-region input\textendash{}output (MRIO) database
                   in the Virtual IELab cloud-computing laboratory
                   environment. Whereas EXIOBASE2 is constructed using a
                   multi-process reconciliation procedure, we present an
                   alternative compilation technique that uses
                   EXIOBASE2's pre-processed data and final tables in
                   reconciling the IELab MRIO with conflicting raw data
                   information. This approach skips the labour-intensive
                   step of detailing and harmonising country tables.
                   Adherence metrics reveal the EXIOBASE2-based IELab
                   table to be considerably less balanced than the
                   original but with stronger adherence to other
                   constraints data. However, these metrics are not
                   comparable to the original EXIOBASE2 statistics due
                   to the distinctive implementation of constraint sets
                   in the two platforms. IELab's main value-added is its
                   flexibility in tailoring EXIOBASE2-based MRIOs beyond
                   the original recipe. Finally, IELab's global carbon,
                   water and material footprints are shown to be
                   comparable with previously reported resource
                   footprints. In contrast, deviations in land
                   footprints warrant further investigation.},

Depending on purpose or application, MRIO construction and usage has been hampered by a lack of geographical and sectoral detail; at the time of writing, the most advanced initiatives opt for a breakdown into at most 129 regions and 120 sectors. Not all existing global MRIO frameworks feature continuous time series, margins and tax sheets, and information on reliability and uncertainty. Despite these potential limitations, constructing a large MRIO requires significant manual labour and many years of time. This paper describes the results from a project aimed at creating an MRIO account that represents all countries at a detailed sectoral level, allows continuous updating, provides information on data reliability, contains table sheets expressed in basic prices as well as all margins and taxes, and contains a historical time series. We achieve these goals through a high level of procedural standardisation, automation, and data organisation.},
